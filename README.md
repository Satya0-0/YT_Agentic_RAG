# YT_Agentic_RAG
An Agentic RAG model which downloads a YouTube video, converts it to a transcript, stores this transcript in ChromaDB to allow users to perform question-answer over the Video content. This implements LLM-as-a-Judge for retrieval accuracy, Query-rewriting for better retrievals, and Web-fallback as last option if retrieval fails
